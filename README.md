## Dataset
Causes of Death - Our World In Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivanchvez/causes-of-death-our-world-in-data)

## Why did I chose this dataset?
I chose this data because I was interested in deaths around the world. I wanted to know what the causes of death were and in which country. Eventually, it led me to focus on cardiovascular deaths. I did use AI to create my graphs, but I tried learning all the code and its purpose.
## Progress
- [x] Picked dataset
- [X] Defined 10 questions
- [X] Answered 10 questions using Pandas
- [X] Added at least one data visualization (using Matplotlib and/or Seaborn) to each single question
- [X] Prepared presentation slides to present at graduation

## Questions
- [x] Question 1: What is the total trend of deaths over time?
<img width="1646" height="895" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d05b4d0-23a2-4a2a-a282-c93677dd85ef" />

- Based on this graph, I can see that deaths over time have increased dramatically from 1990 to 2019. I first wanted to see if deaths over time increased or decreased. It seems our deaths overall have only increased.
 
      
- [x] Question 2: What are the top 5 causes of death in 2019
  - <img width="962" height="1285" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fac8746-8576-4c69-b4c4-5fee242dca56" />
  
- I then wanted to check what the most common deaths in 2019 were around the world. It turns out that many people die due to cardiovascular diseases. I then wanted to check what deaths were like in America due to cardiovascular diseases.

- [x] Question 3: What were the cardiovascular disease deaths like in America
  <img width="1187" height="642" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cba1cd0-4c18-4253-870b-8259ee96e167" />

 - Based on the graph, cardiovascular disease deaths skyrocketed to 2.1 million in 2019. The deaths only continue to rise up. This made me wonder what other major countries had cardiovascular deaths at a all time high.

- [x] Question 4: What were the cardiovascular deaths like in other countries
 <img width="1664" height="815" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee0b8ada-1175-40c5-b9f1-1473ad3ea6c9" />

- In this graph, I can see that America didn't have the highest death of cardiovascular deaths. China had the most cardiovascular deaths among all other major countries. 

- [ ] Question 5: Cardiovascular Deaths vs Chronic Kidney Deaths
  <img width="1373" height="839" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a125cfce-1e23-4a9a-896a-206dc06fa69e" />

- In this plot, I can see that cardiovascular deaths remain at an all-time high while chronic kidney deaths were at an all-time low. This made me believe that these two causes of death had no correlation with each other.

- [ ] Question 6: Non-communicable deaths vs. Communicable Deaths
  <img width="1137" height="795" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f50cc205-c03d-40e5-b3b2-1a861d7a9fd5" />

- In the pie chart, I can see that there is a lot more non-communicable deaths than communicable deaths. But this could have been due to the fewer columns of NCD than communicable deaths. However, a 3 percent communicable death is far too low than the non-communicable deaths.   

- [ ] Question 7: Non-communicable Deaths vs Communicable Deaths over time
<img width="1137" height="795" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a22feda1-f0b3-4b9d-9c56-717a1c58b68e" />

I wanted to see what the non-communicable deaths and communicable deaths were like overtime. In this graph, we can see that noncommunicable deaths are at an all-time high, even throughout the years. However, communicable deaths are still there,e but not as severe as the noncommunicable ones. 

- [ ] Question 8: China VS America Cardiovascular Deaths
 <img width="1647" height="810" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2faf5967-5d20-4a9b-8757-8c3faeeb75ab" />

 - I wanted to see how big a gap there was between China and America's cardiovascular deaths. America's death rate was way below China's, and China's cardiovascular death rate is at an all-time high and continuing to grow.
   
- [ ] Question 9: Cardiovascular Deaths VS Chronic Respiratory Deaths
<img width="946" height="786" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fe0fed8-a243-4abd-9902-9f434c10c186" />

- I wanted to again compare between two causes of death, cardiovascular deaths to chronic respiratory deaths. In this scatter plot, you can see that there is a correlation between the two causes of death. The plot shows that the two causes of death are intertwined and are nearly around each other. This makes me believe that these two causes of death may have a correlation with each other.

- [ ] Question 10: China VS USA Chronic Respiratory Diseases
<img width="1640" height="819" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88003fb3-0161-4e61-b0ca-824a858cfd21" />

- I wanted to then check on China's and America's respiratory disease since it correlated with cardiovascular disease. Like before China has more deaths than the US. However, China's respiratory deaths are declining, and the US's deaths are steadily increasing.
