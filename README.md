## Dataset
Causes of Death - Our World In Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivanchvez/causes-of-death-our-world-in-data)

## Why did I chose this dataset?

I chose this data because I was interested in deaths around the world. I wanted to know what the causes of death were and in which country. I did use AI to create my graphs, but I tried learning all the code and its purpose.

## Progress
- [x] Picked dataset
- [X] Defined 10 questions
- [X] Answered 10 questions using Pandas
- [X] Added at least one data visualization (using Matplotlib and/or Seaborn) to each single question
- [X] Prepared presentation slides to present at graduation

## Questions
- [x] Question 1: What is the total trend of deaths over time?

- Based on this graph, I can see that deaths over time have increased dramatically from 1990 to 2019. I first wanted to see if deaths over time increased or decreased. It seems our deaths overall have only increased.
 
      
- [x] Question 2: What are the top 5 causes of death in 2019

- I then wanted to check what the most common deaths in 2019 were around the world. It turns out that many people die due to cardiovascular diseases. I then wanted to check what deaths were like in America due to cardiovascular diseases.

- [x] Question 3: What were the cardiovascular disease deaths like in America
  <img width="1187" height="642" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cba1cd0-4c18-4253-870b-8259ee96e167" />

 - Base on the graph cardiovascular disease deaths sky rocketed to 2.1 million 

- [x] Question 4: Does price vary with airlines?
  - Answer: Yes, Vistara and Air India are the more expensive airlines, which are full-service-carriers (FSCs). The other airlines are considered low-cost-carriers (LCCs).
