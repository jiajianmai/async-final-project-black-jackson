## Dataset
Airlines Flights Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitgrewal/airlines-flights-data/data)

## Why did I chose this dataset?
I chose the Airlines Flights Data because I recently came back from a few trips where I had to take the plane. I was fascinated by the intricate systems pilots and other employees have to be familiar with at the airport. I am interested in learning more about the data they have to know about on a daily basis.
